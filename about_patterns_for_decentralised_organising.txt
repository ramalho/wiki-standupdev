===== About Patterns for Decentralised Organising =====

==== 2017 workshop tour ====

This year we’re touring the world, meeting with all kinds of groups who are trying to work without hierarchical management structures: co-ops, startups, NGOs, companies, activist networks, etc. We host workshops to share the body of knowledge we’re collecting along the way.

==== Enspiral: more people working on stuff that matters ====

Enspiral is a self-organising **network **of self-organising **companies **and **teams**. We support each other to do **meaningful work**: education, governance, food systems, conscious entrepreneurship, mad science, “stuff that matters”.

We are pragmatic idealists learning how to use our **differences as a collective resource**. We are focussed on many **different projects** and we use **different language** to describe who we are and what we do.

Our **shared values** mean we prioritise the **common good **before private gain. We are discovering organisational structures that encourage **relationships of respect** and **equality** rather than **hierarchy** and **domination**.

==== Loomio: technology for decentralised organising ====

Loomio is open source software for **small scale digital democracy**. There are people all over the world, in groups of 3-300, using it to **deliberate** and **make decisions** to organise themselves. **Co-ops** write their constitution, **companies** decide on the annual budget and strategy, **boards** make decisions between meetings, **activists** coordinate community projects, **philanthropists** approve funding applications, **government officials** and **experts** deliberate with **citizens** on new policy.

Loomio is built by a worker-owned cooperative in Aotearoa New Zealand, globally respected for our commitment to **ethical business** and **non-hierarchical management**.
